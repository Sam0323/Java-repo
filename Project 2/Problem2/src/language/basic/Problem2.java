//Write a java program to print studentâ€™s total marks, percentage and grade. User input is
//given to enter number of subjects and then prompts user to enter marks. Calculate Total
//marks, Student Percentage, Student Grade.
//
//Note:
//1. Maximum marks for a subject is 100.
//2. percentage = (totalMarks/(count*100)) * 100;
//>=90 is Grade A
//>=80 and <=89.99 is Grade B
//>=70 and <=79.99 is Grade C
//>=60 and <=69.99 is Grade D
//< 60 is Fail
//
//Tips: use scanner for inputs, use for loop (to iterate and store marks), use switch statement
//(to print grades).
//
//Sample Output:
//Enter Number of Subject(s):
//3
//Enter Marks of 3 Subject(s):
//70
//80
//90
//Total Marks : 240
//Student Percentage: 80
//Student Grade : B
